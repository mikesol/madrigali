Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high,
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby.
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue,
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true.

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me.
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me.

Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly.
Birds fly over the rainbow.
Why then, oh why can't I?

If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why can't I?


175 from if happy works great till 181ish (before rap … too many happys) %%%
225 good schloss (make the second one (fake shorter)) %%%
253-276 - has some repeated stuff from before, but is ok, at least in beginning. %%%
287 nice island in the middle :: it's the slow to triumphant ridiculous ::: %%%
339-344 other beginning possibility (changed in transcription) ::: %%%
358 good slow point ::: %%%
381 nice fake climax…can be blended @ end into opera? %%%
408 decent chimney joke %%%
419-428 like repeat in blue - in general good %%%
431 - can get away with this if spaced far from previous material - needs to be pushed to orgasmic extreme %%%
458 - can be made to work ok %%% 
469 - after Trecartin 1 [ok, but too literal in lyrics at first] - gets good at 483 to 496 %%%
504 - good ::: %%%
518 - ok repetition ::: %%%
526 - good elan till 536 ::: %%%
558 city lights (maybe middle mark) [can plan this out better - love arabic-ish @ end]
613 - nice gear shift change till 630 , then autistic ::: %
651 - opera %%%
661 - nice proof of skill…need to figure out how to get out ::: %%%
688 - good pacing, would just need to un-monophonic (711 can become nice extra joke) ::: %%%
1036 - high ::: %%%
1042 - haha, he said "real cum" ::: %%%
**********
135-141 ok, but then 142 going down is a keeper till 146ish
**********
546 - some shit, but the "there's a" is precious - keep
721 - good pacing too up till bluebirds, which is boring (combined now into 689)
586 - just a bit and let it go to a Shatner sings space
454 - cute
8-16
66 - good start :::
73-82
82-91 (repeat can't i: really aiming for something like 91, avoid stuff like 98, what is before can shaped)
modulation around 218 but not the stupid lullaby thing
246 can be interesting


350 -- TOO MUCH TORUBLES MELT.
