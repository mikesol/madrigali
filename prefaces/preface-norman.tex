\section*{norman (age 29) wakes up}
Don't give up on me life\\
Don't give up\\
Don't give up on me, Norman\\\\
The sky is burning and I'm running out of peanut butter\\
Flower and an aneurysm, birdie want a motorcycle?\\
Heaven is a Norman in my armor with a dilatory\\
Motion for the changing of Magillicutty's table water.\\
Took it to the limit but I didn't pay the piper\\
So I sold it to a Rosenblatt for eighty-seven dollars,\\
It was cheaper than a killer monkey.\\
No! No! No! No!\\
\hfill\\
Holy shit, mom,\\
I met a girl,\\
Her name is me.\\
Holy shit, mom,\\
I met a girl,\\
Her name is N O R M A N R O S E N B L A T T.\\
Yeah you show it,\\
Don't you know it don't you blow it.\\
Grab it, grow it, ram it, row it.\\
Roseblatt.\\
\\\hfill\\
He wasn't a writer.\\
Pulling a fast all nighter.\\
Norman, he wasn't, he doesn't\\
His cousin fuzzin wasn't there\\
Don't care, it's Norman bear...\\
You, Norman.\\
\\\hfill\\
Norman Rosenblatt sold me this toaster.\\
Have you ever heard my name.\\
Norman Rosenblatt won't touch the Torah.\\
Norman Rosenblatt likes when it's sunny.\\
Norman Rosen\\
\\\hfill\\
The ubiquitous Norman Rosenblatt\\
Was a two faced twist tats alley cat\\
Who was snug as a bug in a rug till a thug\\
Whose name was fate came knocking on his door.\\
The ubiquitous Norman alley cat\\
Was a real Democrat, now how bout that.\\
Rat.\\
Norman was a healthy eater.  Yes.\\
\\\hfill\\
Norman, Willy Mays he\\
No\\
The eighteenth inning.\\
\\\hfill\\
Schlo\ss{}!\\
Schlo\ss{}!\\
What a kidder,\\
Norman Roblatt.\\
(Rosenblatt he's where it's Schlo\ss{}.)\\
Norman, oh\\
Norman's someone you oughtta know.\\
Holy Rosenblatt I'm ready to go.\\
I'm ready, stronger than dirt, Norman.\\
Norman thought of\\
No Schlo\ss{}\\
(no Schlo\ss{}).\\
\\\hfill\\
We've searched the highest highs.\\
We've hit the lowest lows.\\
We've asked the wisest whys and\\
Still we don't know which way to go.\\
No still we don't know where to go.\\
We've searched the...\\
As well as the...\\
We've asked the wisest whys and\\
Norman, Sandy Koufax blew a shut out\\
In the eighteenth inning.\\
Don't give up on me life\\
Because I'm sailing Rosenblatt, Norman.\\
B C-sharp D, Norman.\\
The sky is burning and I'm running out of, shh!\\
\\\hfill\\
The ubiquitous Norman Rosenblatt\\
Never left a paper where he sat.\\
The ubiquitous Norman Rosenblatt\\
He preferred a keepah to his hat.\\
The ubiquitous Norman Roseblatt\\
Knew Liviticus 4:1 down pat.\\
Manners and a banner on the go he was a Norman Rosen,\\
Norman Rosenblatt.\\
Norman took her hand and helped her cross the road,\\
Reading tea leaves in his coffee,\\
Have you heard the news?\\
Yes I saw you,\\
Norman, you're my love\\
You'll never know how much I love you.\\
Rosenblatt took the time to write me,\\
Pushing up the daisies.\\
\\\hfill\\
Norman he stopped and he tied his shoe\\
Have you ever heard my name.\\
I left a message saying meet me\\
On the stoop after five.\\
Slices and dices and coffee, coffee, and they\\
Laughed.
And they\\
Scratched.
And they went outside.\\
Norman wakes up on the bus with his arms open wide.\\
And he cried, let me off of the ride.\\
He lied,\\
Rosenblatt.\\
